# Comecocos

## Introduction
This project involves implementing a version of the iconic Pac-Man video game to explore and apply key concepts of hardware description on an FPGA platform.

## Languages and tools
This project has been developed using:
- VHDL.
- VIVADO Design Suite.
- Timing and constraing tools (.xdc files)

## Hardware


## Concepts applied
In the project, there are several important concepts that have been applied, such as:
- The design of efficients **Fisical State Machines**.
- Clean and commented code for better readability and understanding.
- An efficient use of the FPGA resources.
- Modular design to improve scalability and code reusability.
- Memory mapping and video signal generation for visual output.
- Pixel-based graphics control using VGA.
- Testing and simulation of components using testbenches.
- Top-down design methodology, starting from high-level architecture down to low-level modules.
